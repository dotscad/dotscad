# dotscad: OpenSCAD Things

This repository is intended as a central hub for [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)
users to showcase their works and make them available for other people to use, modify,
and enhance.

Things are organized into submodules by theme/category (e.g. photography or toy trains),
so please browse toward whichever strikes your fancy. 

## How to Use

The easiest way to use these Things is to find those with a link at the top of the file
to their page at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/), where you will find
renderings, photographs, and downloadable STL files that you can send directly to your
3D printer.

If you wish to dig deeper, you will need to familiarize yourself with 
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), a 3D modeling program that uses a scripting
language to render objects, rather than a visual editor.  If you wish to modify or
configure any of the Things in this repository you will need to
[download OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and then spend some time
reading the [language documentation](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html).

## How to Participate

If you wish to contribute something new to a particular submodule, please submit it as
a pull request against the submodule itself.

If your Thing doesn't fit into any of the existing submodules, please submit a request
via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/dotscad/dotscad/issues) to join our team
and create a new submodule.
