# dotscad: OpenSCAD Things

This github organization is intended as a central hub for [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)
users to showcase their works and make them available for other people to use, modify,
and enhance.

This repository contains a set of module files intended to supplement those available elsewhere
in the community (e.g. [MCAD](https://github.com/SolidCode/MCAD)).

Other repositories in this organization contain Things organized into submodules by theme/category
(e.g. photography or toy trains), so please browse toward whichever strikes your fancy.

## How to Use: modules

After cloning this repository, just `use` the module of your choice.  E.g.

    use <dotscad/pie.scad>;
    pie(40, 45, 5);

The source code for each module will contain a detailed explanation of what it does.

## How to Use: Things

The easiest way to use these Things is to find those with a link at the top of the file
to their page at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/), where you will find
renderings, photographs, and downloadable STL files that you can send directly to your
3D printer.

If you wish to dig deeper, you will need to familiarize yourself with
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), a 3D modeling program that uses a scripting
language to render objects, rather than a visual editor.  If you wish to modify or
configure any of the Things in this repository you will need to
[download OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and then spend some time
reading the [language documentation](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html).

## How to Participate

We are always happy to welcome new members to the dotscad community.

If you wish to contribute a fix or enhancement for an existing module or Thing, please
submit it as a pull request.

If your Thing doesn't fit into any of the existing repositories, please submit a request
via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/dotscad/dotscad/issues) to join our team
and create a new repository to host your Thing.
